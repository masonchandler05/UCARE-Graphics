Analysis on Statistical Atlas from 9th census 


This projects purpose is to look back at old census/statistical atlas graphs and test the accuracy in which they were created and recreate the data in several different forms to test for the accuracy in which people can interprete them quantatitively. This data was represented in "doughnut" forms with a circle inside a cirle to show the growth and area from 1860 to 1870. Since the data is over 150 years old, there can be many errors in the creation of graphics, so I am looking into the actual census data and comparing it to the graphics to understand the accuracy of census data and visuals. 

Once the analysis of the accuracy of the graphics is finished, I will do some research on the disabled groups represented in the graphics to understand the importance of this data and how it may have been used/interpreted. This data used outdated termanology that needs to be corrected as well as lots of funding going towards these groups around this time. This data could have been used for malicous purposes as well as good ones. It could perpetuate racist attitudes as the data was shown as "colored" and "white" so it could cause poeple to continue to see minorities as less than people if they are mentally disabled at higher rates. However, this data could also be used to help secure funding for these disabled groups. 

Finally, I will recreate these visuals as well as more traditional graphics to test how accuratly people can interepret different types of graphical forms. This will also likely involve designing the experiment to test to see if any illusions cause any bias's on the interpretation of the data. From there, I will analyze the data and write a paper over everything.
